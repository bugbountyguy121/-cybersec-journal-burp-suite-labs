## Error-based SQL injection (cheat sheets)

For the First lab:
Error-based SQL injection
                                     Error-based SQL injection refers to cases where you're able  to use error messages to either extract or infer sensitive data from the  database, even in blind contexts. The possibilities depend on the  configuration of the database and the types of errors you're able to  trigger:
            •                 You may be able to induce the application to return a specific error response based on the result of a boolean expression. You can exploit this in the same way as the conditional responses we looked at in the previous section. For more information, see Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional errors.
            •                 You may be able to trigger error messages that output the data returned by the query. This effectively turns otherwise blind SQL injection vulnerabilities into visible ones. For more information, see Extracting sensitive data via verbose SQL error messages.



Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional errors
                                     Some applications carry out SQL queries but their behavior  doesn't change, regardless of whether the query returns any data. The  technique in the previous section won't work, because injecting  different boolean conditions makes no difference to the application's  responses.
                          It's often possible to induce the application to return a  different response depending on whether a SQL error occurs. You can  modify the query so that it causes a database error only if the  condition is true. Very often, an unhandled error thrown by the database  causes some difference in the application's response, such as an error  message. This enables you to infer the truth of the injected condition.

To see how this works, suppose that two requests are sent containing the following TrackingId cookie values in turn:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a
xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


 Breakdown of the Code Snippet

The core of the snippet is the use of the CASE statement and the division by zero:
• CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END:
◇ 1=2: This condition is always false.

◇ THEN 1/0: This is the action taken if the condition is true. Dividing by zero (1/0) throws an error in SQL databases (like a Division by zero error).

◇ ELSE 'a': This is the action taken if the condition is false. The query will return the character 'a'.

◇ Since 1=2 is false, the expression safely returns 'a', and the 1/0 error is never triggered.


 These inputs use the CASE keyword to test a condition and return a different expression depending on whether the expression is true:
            •                 With the first input, the CASE expression evaluates to 'a', which does not cause any error.
            •                 With the second input, it evaluates to 1/0, which causes a divide-by-zero error.

 If the error causes a difference in the application's HTTP  response, you can use this to determine whether the injected condition  is true.
             Using this technique, you can retrieve data by testing one character at a time:
So in this case we want to first get thhe a then latter on force getting an error


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
xyz' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END FROM Users)='a

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



For the Second lab:

Extracting sensitive data via verbose SQL error messages
Misconfiguration of the database sometimes results in verbose error messages. These can provide information that may be useful to an attacker. For example, consider the following error message, which occurs after injecting a single quote into an id parameter:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unterminated string literal started at position 52 in SQL SELECT * FROM tracking WHERE id = '''. Expected char
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



This shows the full query that the application constructed using our input. We can see that in this case, we're injecting into a single-quoted string inside a WHERE statement. This makes it easier to construct a valid query containing a malicious payload. Commenting out the rest of the query would prevent the superfluous single-quote from breaking the syntax.



Extracting sensitive data via verbose SQL error messages - Continued

Occasionally, you may be able to induce the application to  generate an error message that contains some of the data that is  returned by the query. This effectively turns an otherwise blind SQL  injection vulnerability into a visible one.
             You can use the CAST() function to achieve  this. It enables you to convert one data type to another. For example,  imagine a query containing the following statement:



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CAST((SELECT example_column FROM example_table) AS int)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Often, the data that you're trying to read is a string. Attempting to convert this to an incompatible data type, such as an int, may cause an error similar to the following:        


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: "Example data"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 This type of query may also be useful if a character limit prevents you from triggering conditional responses.
