The PortSwigger Academy Master Vault

This repository serves as my comprehensive, actively maintained knowledge base for the entire PortSwigger Web Security Academy curriculum. It is more than just a collection of lab solutions; it is a living methodology designed to streamline future web application penetration tests and aid in competitive bug bounty hunting.

Key Focus Areas:

    100% Coverage Goal: Dedicated to documenting all labs across every major vulnerability class, from foundational concepts to advanced, multi-step attack chains.

    Methodology & Structure: Notes are organized hierarchically (via CherryTree export) to reflect a logical testing process. Each write-up focuses on the 'Why' as much as the 'How', detailing the thought process behind vulnerability discovery and exploitation.

    Bug Bounty Ready: The documentation is formatted for quick reference, ensuring rapid recall of successful Payloads, Request Templates, and Bypass Techniques proven effective against PortSwigger's realistic web environments.

    Tooling Integration: Specific emphasis is placed on the configuration and usage of Burp Suite Professional, including custom extensions, intruder settings, and manual payload construction for complex vulnerabilities (e.g., race conditions, blind injections).

This repository is the product of hundreds of hours of hands-on practice, intended to be the definitive reference for applying PortSwigger principles in any real-world security assessment.
